# MySqlTransaction.SaveAsync method

Asynchronously sets a named transaction savepoint with the specified *savepointName*. If the current transaction already has a savepoint with the same name, the old savepoint is deleted and a new one is set.

```csharp
public Task SaveAsync(string savepointName, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
```
