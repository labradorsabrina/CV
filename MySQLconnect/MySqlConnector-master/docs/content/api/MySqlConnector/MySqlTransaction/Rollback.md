```csharp
public void Rollback(string savepointName)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| savepointName | The savepoint name. |

## Remarks

The name must have been created with [`Save`](../Save/), but not released by calling [`Release`](../Release/).

The proposed ADO.NET API that this is based on is not finalized; this API may change in the future.
