# MySqlBulkCopy.MySqlRowsCopied event

This event is raised every time that the number of rows specified by the [`NotifyAfter`](../NotifyAfter/) property have been processed.

```csharp
public event MySqlRowsCopiedEventHandler MySqlRowsCopied;
```

## Remarks

Receipt of a RowsCopied event does not imply that any rows have been sent to the server or committed.

The [`Abort`](../../MySqlRowsCopiedEventArgs/Abort/) property can be set to `true` by the event handler to abort the copy.
